# Sorry

Hello there!

I'm currently looking for a coding job, so I decided to create an app based on the board game "Sorry" to showcase my Java language competency.

Here's a quick demo video if you'd like to see the app in action:

The app is relatively simple. There are only two classes, Main Activity and BoardModel. MainActivity handles app functionality and UI changes. BoardModel handles all of the game's logic.

So how does the game logic work?
